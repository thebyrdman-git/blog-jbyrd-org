## The Uncomfortable Conversation

You're on a customer call. They're struggling with a problem you've seen three times this quarter. You know exactly what would help: the Red Hat Training course that covers this scenario in depth, but you hesitate to share this little bit of information.

*"Will they think I'm trying to sell them something?"*

*"They've already bought training licenses‚Äîwhy haven't they used them?"*

*"I don't even know what they have access to..."*

So you solve the immediate problem, document it, and move on. Three weeks later, the same issue resurfaces with a different team member.

Sound familiar?

## The Gap We Identified

Back in March 2025, my colleagues Claude, Nick, and I kept running into the same pattern: TAMs weren't effectively recommending training to customers, even when it would clearly help both parties.

Not because TAMs don't care. Not because customers don't need it. But because **we lacked a practical framework for having these conversations.**

We had questions:
- When is the right time to bring up training?
- How do you position it as trusted advisor work, not sales?
- What do you do when customers resist?
- How do you even know what training access they have?

So we decided to find answers‚Äîtogether.

## Six Months of Collaboration

What started as a casual conversation became a sustained initiative. Over the next six months, we:

**Researched the landscape** (March-June)
- Talked to TAMs about their hesitations
- Reviewed customer training utilization patterns
- Identified where training conversations were working (and where they weren't)

**Built practical frameworks** (July-September)
- Developed customer persona strategies (4 distinct types)
- Created timing approaches for different scenarios
- Documented tactics for overcoming resistance

**Created actionable content** (September-October)
- Compiled everything into a 20-minute presentation
- Built speaker notes with real scenarios
- Prepared for delivery to North America TAM teams

The result: **"Making Training Stick"** ‚Äî a practical guide for TAMs to champion customer learning.

## What We Learned

### 1. Know What They Have (Before You Recommend)

You can't effectively recommend training if you don't know what customers can already access. We learned to:
- Work with Luis from the Red Hat Training Team to get customer entitlement reports
- Add training access to account one-pagers
- Review patterns in customer assessment reports for repetitive issues that signal skill gaps

**Pro tip:** That "DNF update fails with exclude filtering error - reported 2 times" in your assessment? Perfect candidate for RHEL training recommendation.

### 2. Timing is Everything

Don't lead with training in your first customer call. Build trust first. The right moments emerge:
- **After establishing rapport** - They trust your judgment
- **During repetitive issues** - "I notice we've seen this twice..."
- **Before major projects** - AAP 2.6 upgrade coming? Perfect time to mention updated courses
- **After wins** - "That solution worked great! Want to dive deeper?"

### 3. Four Customer Personas

We identified four types of customers when it comes to training:

**The Enthusiast** üòä  
Has training, wants more. Easy win‚Äîjust keep recommendations coming.

**The Forgetter** üòê  
Has training licenses, doesn't use them. Show ROI: "You already have access‚Äîlet me show you what's available."

**The Curious** ü§î  
No training yet, but interested. Bring in the training team for customized paths. Demo free interactive labs.

**The Resistant** üôÖ  
Not interested. Don't push! Plant seeds. Show YOUR training: "I just took RH294 and learned..."

### 4. It's Not Selling‚ÄîIt's Advising

The key mindset shift: **You're helping customers maximize their Red Hat investment.**

They've often already purchased training. You're ensuring they USE it. That's trusted advisor work, not sales.

## The Practical Approach

Here's what we recommend TAMs do differently:

**General Awareness Building:**
- Point to free resources first (interactive labs, blogs, Red Hat User Groups)
- Show value before mentioning paid courses
- Make it low-pressure: "Have you checked out Red Hat Learning Subscription?"

**Targeted Recommendations (Most Effective):**
- Build demos directly from training courses: "If you liked that, there's a whole course..."
- Link case solutions to specific chapters: "Chapter 7 of RH294 covers this exact scenario"
- Bring the training team into customer calls for customized training paths

**Lead by Example:**
- Take Red Hat training yourself
- Share your learning experiences with customers
- Build your demos and workshops from course content

## Real Impact

Claude recommended Ansible Navigator content from RH294, "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Automation with Ansible," to a customer. They took the training. Result? Fewer basic questions, more strategic automation discussions. The relationship elevated.

For me, I converted onsite visits into educational workshops, building demos directly from Red Hat training content. Customers saw immediate value and enrolled team members.

When you show evidence of practicing what you're preaching, customers listen.

## Coming Soon: TAM Team Enablement

In mid-November, we're presenting "Making Training Stick" to the North America FSI TAM team. If it resonates, we'll roadshow it to other TAM teams across North America.

Our goal: Equip every TAM with practical tactics to champion customer learning‚Äîmaking our jobs easier while helping customers succeed.

We're also developing a 1+ hour deep dive session covering:
- Building custom training paths with customers
- Converting onsites to educational workshops
- Measuring training ROI
- Advanced resistance tactics

## The Challenge

If you're a TAM reading this, here's your challenge for this week:

1. ‚úÖ Check training entitlements for ONE customer
2. ‚úÖ Identify ONE skill gap from your recent cases
3. ‚úÖ Make ONE recommendation (course, free lab, or training team intro)
4. ‚úÖ Share your results with your team

Remember: You're not selling. You're influencing customers for their betterment.

## Why This Matters

When customers skill up:
- Your conversations get easier (they ask better questions)
- Repetitive issues decrease (they solve more on their own)
- Your relationship elevates (strategic advisor, not firefighter)
- They get better ROI on their Red Hat investment

**Making training stick isn't just good for customers‚Äîit's good for TAMs.**
