# Welcome!

This is the technical blog of Jimmy Byrd, where I share insights on:

- **Red Hat Enterprise Solutions** - TAM perspective on RHEL, Ansible, OpenShift
- **Infrastructure Automation** - Ansible, GitOps, CI/CD pipelines
- **System Administration** - Home lab adventures with MiracleMax
- **Personal AI Infrastructure** - Building PAI tools for productivity

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about real-world technical challenges, solutions I've implemented, and lessons learned from both enterprise environments and my home lab.

Stay tuned for posts on:
- Ansible Automation Platform deployments
- Red Hat customer case studies (anonymized)
- Home lab infrastructure automation
- Personal AI tool development

Thanks for reading!

â€” Jimmy
